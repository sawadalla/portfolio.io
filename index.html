    <h1 style="color:white"> About me</h1>
   <h1 style= "font-size:110%; color:white"> The technological developments in the multimedia world have always mesmerized me. I have always wanted to be within the realm of engineering and computers because of the world of computers and their integration that has exploded in recent years. 
I believe that Mathematics is a key part of computing and life. My studies in Mathematics have strengthened and cemented my interest in computing. Being ambitious and willing to face challenges, asking questions and exploring problems are the key to my interest in Mathematics and Engineering.

Being the former Secretary of National Honor Society has allowed me to demonstrate scholarship, character, leadership, and service. As part of my “give-back” to the community, I have provided Mathematics support to middle schools and high school students for all of my high school years. I have continued to do so in college by volunteering to teach calculus to kids who want to learn how to code. I have earned the President’s Volunteer Service Award. Through these placements, I have improved my confidence, communication skills, collaboration and independent working skills. These skills will be extremely useful in any career. 

Alongside my studies I believe that physical fitness is important. In my leisure times, I play basketball, martial arts, volleyball, football, and swimming. I won 2nd place in a Sparing Martial Arts Tournament in my category. I worked hard to practice with my peers to achieve the honorable place. I played in a basketball team for my school; the opportunity to play in a basketball team has enabled me to work as part of a group. Being a member of a team required commitment to training and a high level of self-motivation. These skills are some of the skills that I can use at university to help me be on top of my work and to motivate my peers<h1>
